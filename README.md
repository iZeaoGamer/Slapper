# Slapper
The new home of Slapper, the NPC plugin for PocketMine-MP, and other spoons.

## UPDATED:
I've now updated the plugin to make the plugin support spoons, so it should work with: GenisysPro, and Tesseract.

## UPDATED:
I've also fixed the server crash - bug.
I bumped the API to 3.0.1. the API was incompatible with the versions of the server, so I updated it to 3.0.1 to make full-compatibilitie with it.

## NOTE:
I am not coping other developer's plugins of hard work. I am trying to make them come back to life, and making them compatible with spoons again, such as tesseract and genisysPro.

## How to install?
go to the release tabs.
Click on '1.3.5 - Server crash fix'
Install it.
Add it to your server in your plugins folder.
done. restart the server, and it should be all good.
